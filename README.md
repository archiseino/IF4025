# IF4025 - Pervasive Computing

Pervasive computing is a concept where technology is seamlessly integrated into our everyday lives, often without us even noticing it. It's the idea that computers and technology will be everywhere, from our homes and workplaces to public spaces and even our bodies. I still don't know what I will be doing here, does it like literature research on Pervasive Computing itself? (I don't know either)

- Pervasive Computing itself is a way to put the computation power to everyday object (note: can be physically, or just a software) do things outside out of the box.
- There are 5 principle of Pervasive Computing

1. Context-Aware: The devices or software can sense and adapt to the environment and user activity in the real time. This mean that the system can understands the various contextual data like locations, time, weather, user preferences accordingly. One example to put is that every time a person wake up, a google phone show the weather prediction for that day.
2. Interoperability: The devices ability to work seamless (secara lancar) with various devices, regardless of the manufacturer, type and etc.. One example is that the Smartlight and Smartphone can be work in symphony in order to turn on the light.
3. Autonomous: Work with minimal human intervention. one example is a Smart Vacuum or Smart Car that can work independently based on the sensors and environment.
4. Scalable: The devices ability to expand from small-size to large-size environment. The system is built on top of the modular components, allowing the new system to be installed easily without distrupting.
5. Embedded: Embedded mean that integrating computational powers to everyday objects (such as Lamp, that's why to get SmartLamp, Smartwatch, etc..) in order to make those objects smarter and more functional without user necessary interacting.
